Right now if a typo correction to the title of a story is made, that story is republished as if it were a brand-new story. Could maybe check for small changes especially if page number and/or story are the same.

Right now, an updated story will just be printed to the console and not be republished, which is the right behaviour most of the time because usually it's just a small typo correction. We could however maybe check if the change is big and if so then republish the story with a note that it was updated.
    "This following story was published before, but it has since been updated with significant changes:"
        Or the equivalent in Dutch!
