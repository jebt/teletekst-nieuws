TODOS:
# todo: swap files system for database (sqlite)
# todo: make the merged dict based on time instead of count (e.g. all (meta-)dicts from within the last 48 hours)
# todo: if a minor change is made to a story, make an edit to the telegram, reddit(,etc) posts. for reddit it might be preferable to edit over repost even if the change is major! for telegram the levenshtein distance threshold for major changes could be raised along with this.
# todo: add reddit publisher bot in its own sub
# todo: break up into classes/modules and make more object-oriented

# todo: lengthen the sleep times.

# todo: everything to the cloud (google?) (automatically pick up the code from GitHub)

# todo: if every essential feature and bugfixes are done and the bot is running in the cloud smoothly for a while, create new telegram channel and identity for the bot and invite people.
